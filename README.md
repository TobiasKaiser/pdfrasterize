# pdfrasterize

This script reads a PDF file, converts it to a raster image and converts
it back to PDF.

This can be helpful if there is a problem with a PDF, for example too complex
vector graphics that prevent the document from being printed correctly
(due to memory limitations of the printer) or from being displayed quickly
on the computer.

Searchable and selectable text, the table of contents and all those other nice
features are not preserved through this conversion.
